you wealthy he's generous a 15 over 10 and you don't want to see him again because his accent you say what because of his accent there's the way he talks it's very eotic this guy is joking this guy is mad this one is more than Madness though this one is Village People full on Village People cuz I don't understand accent wait let me ask you all the men that we've dated that speak big big English tell me how how has it panned out for us eh they are not even up to Half the Man what half quarter the man that obor is this man bought a building in just so that he could get your number see I should

evil now are you not my point exactly I am eil but why why don't you date EV men it's obvious that I am a very ambitious and workaholic woman and men don't like that I love ambitious now don't say what you think I want to hear evil men don't like when their women are not dependent on them they would rather do everything for the woman while she just lays around and I am not about that life first of all evil men like to take care of their women they don't like their women to stress they want to spoil their woman they want to pamper their woman they like to treat their women as a queen is supposed to be treated what if it's the stress I like I mean don't get me wrong I love the attention the spoiling and pampering for once in my life but the hustle drives me TR what you look very beautiful when you are angry I am not angry okay M if you say so but you are now hope you stop now no wait I I just want to understand something what exactly is the reason that you are ghosting me because I have not shown you or prove to you that I am a man who does not support a career woman so what exactly is it that you're talking about your life it's in a number mine is here long distance showa H I have 54 properties Lagos the vi that you live in I have 11 properties there alone so if you need me if you say the word it is only one flight away away I will take a flight and I will come here you call me I I show so what I don't understand this thing the the EO accent it gives me an [Applause] [Music] ache so you don't like my accent I'm sorry I didn't it's okay it's okay [Music] [Music] oh just hold up Fork yes good night I'm really sorry it's fine it's not a problem I'm not your spec if I'm not your spec I'm not your spec there's nothing anybody can do about it so it's fine okay good night well you forgot something you forgot this why are you still being nice to me you're clearly very upset so I'm not my being angry with you doesn't mean that I have to be mean to you so it's fine it's not a problem it is what it is good night d [Music] [Music] [Music] hey lady hi so I want to quickly round up my zoom meeting upstairs be back I will sue that man I will sue him for
